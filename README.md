A GitHub Action to get a list of affected atmos stacks for a pull request

---

This project is part of our comprehensive ["SweetOps"](https://cpco.io/sweetops) approach towards DevOps.


It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).












## Introduction

This is a GitHub Action to get a list of affected atmos stacks for a pull request. It optionally installs 
`atmos`, `terraform` and `jq` and runs `atmos describe affected` to get the list of affected stacks. It provides the 
raw list of affected stacks as an output as well as a matrix that can be used further in GitHub action jobs.



## Usage




### Config

The action expects the atmos gitops configuration file to be present in the repository in `./.github/config/atmos-gitops.yaml`.
The config should have the following structure:

```yaml
  atmos-version: 1.45.3
  atmos-config-path: ./rootfs/usr/local/etc/atmos/
  terraform-state-bucket: cptest-core-ue2-auto-gitops
  terraform-state-table: cptest-core-ue2-auto-gitops
  terraform-state-role: arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxxxx:role/cptest-core-ue2-auto-gitops-gha
  terraform-plan-role: arn:aws:iam::yyyyyyyyyyyy:role/cptest-core-gbl-identity-gitops
  terraform-apply-role: arn:aws:iam::yyyyyyyyyyyy:role/cptest-core-gbl-identity-gitops
  terraform-version: 1.5.2
  aws-region: us-east-2
  enable-infracost: false
  sort-by: .stack_slug
  group-by: .stack_slug | split("-") | [.[0], .[2]] | join("-")  
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Please note!** the `terraform-state-*` parameters refer to the S3 Bucket and corresponding meta storage DynamoDB table used to store the Terraform Plan files, and not the "Terraform State". These parameters will be renamed in a subsequent release.  

### Workflow example

```yaml
  name: Pull Request
  on:
    pull_request:
      branches: [ 'main' ]
      types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, closed, labeled, unlabeled]

  jobs:
    context:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        - id: affected
          uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-affected-stacks@v2
          with:
            atmos-gitops-config-path: ./.github/config/atmos-gitops.yaml
            nested-matrices-count: 1

      outputs:
        affected: ${{ steps.affected.outputs.affected }}
        matrix: ${{ steps.affected.outputs.matrix }}

    atmos-plan:
      needs: ["atmos-affected"]
      if: ${{ needs.atmos-affected.outputs.has-affected-stacks == 'true' }}
      name: ${{ matrix.stack_slug }}
      runs-on: ['self-hosted']
      strategy:
        max-parallel: 10
        fail-fast: false # Don't fail fast to avoid locking TF State
        matrix: ${{ fromJson(needs.atmos-affected.outputs.matrix) }}
      ## Avoid running the same stack in parallel mode (from different workflows)
      concurrency:
        group: ${{ matrix.stack_slug }}
        cancel-in-progress: false
      steps:
        - name: Plan Atmos Component
          uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-plan@v1
          with:
            component: ${{ matrix.component }}
            stack: ${{ matrix.stack }}
```
  
### Migrating from `v1` to `v2`

`v2` moves most of the `inputs` to the Atmos GitOps config path `./.github/config/atmos-gitops.yaml`. Simply create this file, transfer your settings to it, then remove the corresponding arguments from your invocations of the `cloudposse/github-action-atmos-affected-stacks` action.

|         name             |
|--------------------------|
| `atmos-version`          |
| `atmos-config-path`      |
| `terraform-state-bucket` |
| `terraform-state-table`  |
| `terraform-state-role`   |
| `terraform-plan-role`    |
| `terraform-apply-role`   |
| `terraform-version`      |
| `aws-region`             |
| `enable-infracost`       |


If you want the same behavior in `v2` as in `v1` you should create config `./.github/config/atmos-gitops.yaml` with the same variables as in `v1` inputs.

```yaml
  - name: Determine Affected Stacks
    uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-affected-stacks@v2
    id: affected
    with:
      atmos-gitops-config-path: ./.github/config/atmos-gitops.yaml
      nested-matrices-count: 1
```

Which would produce the same behavior as in `v1`, doing this:

```yaml
  - name: Determine Affected Stacks
    uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-affected-stacks@v1
    id: affected
    with:
      atmos-version: 1.45.3
      atmos-config-path: ./rootfs/usr/local/etc/atmos/
      terraform-state-bucket: cptest-core-ue2-auto-gitops
      terraform-state-table: cptest-core-ue2-auto-gitops
      terraform-state-role: arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxxxx:role/cptest-core-ue2-auto-gitops-gha
      terraform-plan-role: arn:aws:iam::yyyyyyyyyyyy:role/cptest-core-gbl-identity-gitops
      terraform-apply-role: arn:aws:iam::yyyyyyyyyyyy:role/cptest-core-gbl-identity-gitops
      terraform-version: 1.5.2
      aws-region: us-east-2
      enable-infracost: false
```
