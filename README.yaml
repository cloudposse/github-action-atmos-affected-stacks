# Short description of this project
description: A GitHub Action to get a list of affected atmos stacks for a pull request

introduction: |-
  This is a GitHub Action to get a list of affected atmos stacks for a pull request. It optionally installs 
  `atmos`, `terraform` and `jq` and runs `atmos describe affected` to get the list of affected stacks. It provides the 
  raw list of affected stacks as an output as well as a matrix that can be used further in GitHub action jobs.
